# Vault Simulator

A simple game for learning about how the tokenized vault standard (ERC 4626) works.

## Planning

- 3 seperate vault contracts
- 1 "market" contract that disperses funds to each vault in accordance with the return rate generated by VRF randomness
- put it on goerli arbitrum or mumbai polygon
- use VRF for determining the return rate for each vault
- use chainlink automation to determine when each round starts and ends
- display leaderboard that changes each round
- user with most tokens at the end of the game wins

### Offering 3 different vaults with varying risk/reward

1. (2% to 10%) low risk, low reward. strategy is to fill it with staked ether only (closest thing to the risk free rate in defi)
2. (-50% to 50%) medium risk, medium reward. strategy is to lend/borrow on protocols like compound
3. (-100% to 100%) high risk, high reward. strategy is leveraged and involves liquidity mining shitcoins

### 3 rounds of play

- each round lasts 60 seconds which gives users time to make decisions like how much they want to allocate to each vault

## Concerns

- how to increase funds for users who are holding vault position and keep track
- how to keep track of when (which round) user was invested in which vault so they dont inherit earnings from previous rounds
- black swan event mechanism?
