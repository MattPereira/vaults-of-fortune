A contest where players compete for the highest return on investment over three rounds. Players deposit and withdraw ERC-20 tokens to and from ERC-4626 vaults. Each vault has a different risk/reward profile. Chainlink automation triggers a request to VRF Coordinator that ultimately determines the return on investment for each vault. Highest total assets at the end of round 3 is the champion.

## Notice

- If the contest is on round 3 and state is closed, [DM me on telegram](https://t.me/mattpereira) to reset the game. Only the owner of `Market` contract can call `resetContest`

## How to Play

1. Enter a contest to be airdropped 10,000 GODL tokens
2. Compete for the highest return on investment over 3 rounds that last a maximum of 5 minutes each
3. During each round, allocate your GODL into each vault as you see fit
4. After allocating 100% of your GODL into the vaults, put pressure on the competition by clicking the "ready" button to expadite the round closing process
5. At the end of each round, the market contract sends or takes GODL from the vaults based on the random numbers generated by VRF
6. Highest net worth at the end of round 3 is the winner

- Fix "callback gas limit exceeded" error that occurs when calling `requestRandomness` on VRF Coordinator. Only happens sometimes.
- Hook up better modal component that displays based on events triggered at start, middle, and end of rounds
